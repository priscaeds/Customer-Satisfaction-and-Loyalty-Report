# Project Overview

This is a 2024 dataset from a U.S. retail chain selling electronics and smart home products through both online and physical stores. 
It contains satisfaction scores, purchasing behavior, demographics, support history, and location data.
## Objective

The goal is to create an analytical report that identifies the key factors influencing customer satisfaction and loyalty across different regions, customer demographics, and support experiences.

## Data source

The dataset was provided by Onyx Data as their July 2025 DataDNA Challenge.

## Tools Used

.Microsoft PowerBI

.Dax

## Key Insights

KPIs:

Average satisfaction score = 5.4

Loyalty Level = 30.8%

Support contact Rate = 46.7%

Repeat Purchase Rate = 57.5%

Product Quality emerged as the strongest driver of customer satisfaction, indicating that customers highly value the reliability and overall standard of the product.
Features and Ease of Use contributed least to the overall satisfaction suggesting that customers may find the product lacking in functionality or difficulty to use.

The analysis reveals an inverse relationship between satisfaction and loyalty because low loyalty customers report the highest satisfaction scores. This shows that while these customers are satisfied with the product, they may not feel committed to the brand.

21-30 age group has the highest proportion of high loyalty customers, indicating strong brand engagement among younger adults. In contrast, customers aged 51-60 exhibit.
the lowest loyalty levels, suggesting potential disengagement.

Though the female make up 55% of the total customer base, the male customer reported the highest satisfaction score and loyalty rate despite being the smaller group.

Illinois reports a high customer satisfaction score indicating strong overall experience and positive sentiment among customers in the region while Arizona shows a lower satisfaction score, suggesting potential areas for improvement or support.

Repeat purchasers report higher satisfaction, with an average score of 5.6 compared to 5.1 for one-time buyers. This suggests a strong link between positive experiences and continued buying behavior.

Price as a factor shows an even spread with 3 high loyal, 2 low loyal and 5 medium loyal customers. 
Product Variety seems to be more associated with lower loyalty levels, with only 1 high loyal customer.
In contrast, Ease of Use appears to be the most influential factor driving loyalty, with 7 customers linked to high loyalty compared to just 5 customers with low loyalty and 2 with medium loyalty.

Customer Service seems to be the strongest loyalty driver for Group A, with high rates.
For Group B, Ease of Use and Support Availability shows strong influence with 4 high ratings each. However, the presence of 3 low ratings from Ease of Use suggests mixed experiences within the group.

Customers who contacted support reported a slightly higher average satisfaction score of 5.4, compared to 5.3 among those who did not contact support with a -0.01 point difference. 
However, their loyalty level was significantly lower at 23.2%, compared to 37.5% for customers who did not interact with support.
This suggests that while support users rated their experience slightly better overall, they are less likely to be loyal, indicating thet support resolution alone does not guarantee retention.

## Recommendations

1. Satisfaction alone does not guarantee loyalty. It is essential to explore other factors influencing loyalty so as to strengthen long-term customer retention.
2. Prioritize Ease of Use to drive more loyalty.
3. Tailor customer experience, communication, or ease of use for the older Adults.
4. Consider post-support engagement strategies, sush as follow-ups to reinforce satisfaction and rebuild loyalty after service issues.
5. While product quality is a key strenght, enhancing  usability and features offerings could further improve customer satisfaction and competitiveness.
6. Regions with low satisfaction scores may benefit from targeted initiatives to enhance the customer experience.
7. It seems that products currently align better with the male customers, therefore it is important to investigate and address the needs and preferances of female 
   customers too to achieve a balanced engagement.
